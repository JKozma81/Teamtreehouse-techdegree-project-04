// create a Game class with methods for starting and ending the game,
// handling interactions, getting random phrases,
// checking for a win, and removing a life counter.
/*
The class should include a constructor with the following properties:
missed: used to track the number of missed guesses by the player.
phrases: an array of phrases to use with the game
(you'll use a method to create new instances of the Phrase class).
A phrase should only include letters and spaces â€” no numbers,
punctuation or other special characters.

  // call the showMatchedLetter() method on the phrase
  // and then call the checkForWin() method.
